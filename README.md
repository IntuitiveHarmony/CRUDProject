## Kingfisher Tie Dye

## Approach
I made my CRUD app with a specific user in mind.  I met a person recently who started making and selling tie dye since they retired.  They currently do not have a website so I made this one as a potential starting point for them.  Currently, this web app allows a user to upload, edit, archive and delete items.  I attempted to make this app as simple as I could yet still be a powerful tool for them to use to connect to their customers.

## Unsolved Issues/ Future Upgrades
Here is a list of Items I'd like to address before this is officially launched.
- Link domain name kingfishertiedye.com with the app
- Add social media links
- Checkout feature
- Secure site for checkout feature
- Create single login for business owner that will grant access to adding, editing, archiving and deleting items
- Update static content to reflect business owner's vision
- Teach business owner how to use the app (flash back to teaching my parents how to program the clock on the VCR)
- Have the carousel auto Scroll
- Image upload button with size and quality checks, upload multiple item images for show page carousel
- Add show page carousel
- Implement view full size picture in show page
- Have tags be links that will take user to collection page with items that have same tag that is selected  (I think using .slpit() on the tag array will help)
- Implement more dropdown lists in new and edit pages. Some based on parent lists
- Implement sticky nav for menu on phone version
- Style the links and buttons especially the ones within text
- Make logo smaller
- Fix the background to never cut off and/ or parallax
