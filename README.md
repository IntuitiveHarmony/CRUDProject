## Kingfisher Tie Dye

## Approach
I made my CRUD app with a specific user in mind.  I met a person recently who started making and selling tie dye since they retired.  They currently do not have a website so I made this one as a potential starting point for them.  Currently, this web app allows the owner to upload, edit, archive and delete items.  It allows the user to then view and navigate the database and contact the owner for purchase of items. I attempted to make this app as simple as I could yet still be a powerful tool for them to use to connect to their customers.

## Tech Used
This app is made using Node, Express, AtlasDB, Mongoose and was launched using Heroku.

## Resolved Issues
- Link domain name kingfishertiedye.com with the app (8/20/22)
- Add confirm before delete function

## Unsolved Issues/ Future Upgrades
Here is a list of Items I'd like to address before this is officially launched.
- Add social media links
- Add checkout feature
- Secure the site properly enough to have checkout feature
- Create single login for business owner that will grant access to adding, editing, archiving and deleting items
- Update static content to reflect business owner's vision
- Teach business owner how to use the app (flash back to teaching my parents how to program the clock on the VCR)
- Show error if item doesn't upload or edit correctly
- Have the carousel on index page auto Scroll
- Fix image upload button add size and quality checks, upload multiple item images for show page carousel
- Add carousel within the show page
- Implement "view full size picture" in show page
- Have tags be links that will take user to collection page with items that have same tag that is selected  (I think using .slpit() on the tag array will help)
- Implement more dropdown lists in new and edit pages. Some based on parent lists
- Implement sticky nav for menu on phone version
- Style the links and buttons especially the ones within text
- Make logo smaller (and cuter)
- Clean up CSS to make sure each page feels consistent (looking at you, new, edit and show pages)
- Fix the background to never cut off and/ or parallax
- Require some of the fields in the forms to be filled out so blank entries wont occur
