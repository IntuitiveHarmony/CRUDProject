##Approach
I made my CRUD app with a specific user in mind.  I met a person recently who started making and selling tie dye.  They currently do not have a website so I made this as a starting point for them.  Currently this web app allows a user to upload, edit, archive and delete items.  I attempted to make this app as simple as I could yet still be a powerful tool for them to use to connect to their customers.
